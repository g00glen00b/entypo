Entypo+
=======
This project is a fork of the original experimental script to automate the Entypo font building.
It replaces the original Makefile using font-builder with a Grunt configuration and fontforge. It also includes tags and a valid Bower.json file, making it possible to use this library with build tools like Bower.
