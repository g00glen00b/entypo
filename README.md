Entypo+
===
There's an experimental script to automate the Entypo font building. It's commonly used in web projects, but it's not maintained and isn't really compatible with dependency management tools like Bower because there is no configuration.

This project is a fork of the original Entypo project, and includes Bower configuration and replaces font-builder with fontforge.
